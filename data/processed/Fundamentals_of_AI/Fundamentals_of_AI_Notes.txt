Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent
machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence such as learning, reasoning,
problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
Definitions of AI
John McCarthy defined AI as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. Russell
and Norvig define AI as the study of intelligent agents.
Goals of AI
Learning from data, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, natural language
understanding, perception, and autonomous decision-making.
Types of Artificial Intelligence
Narrow AI (task-specific), General AI (human-level intelligence), and Super AI (beyond human
intelligence).
Core Components of AI
Data, algorithms, and models form the foundation of AI systems.
Fundamental Areas of AI
Machine Learning, Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Inference, Search and Problem
Solving, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics.
Machine Learning
Machine learning enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Types include
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
AI Agents
An AI agent perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it using actuators. Types
include simple reflex, model-based, goal-based, utility-based, and learning agents.
AI vs ML vs Deep Learning
AI is the broad field, ML is a subset of AI, and Deep Learning is a subset of ML based on neural
networks.
Applications of AI
Healthcare, finance, education, transportation, manufacturing, and customer support.
Advantages of AI
High accuracy, automation, faster decision-making, and continuous availability.
Limitations of AI
High cost, data dependency, lack of creativity, ethical and privacy issues.
Ethical and Responsible AI
Fairness, transparency, explainability, privacy, and accountability are critical considerations.
Future Scope of AI
Explainable AI, Edge AI, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI development.
