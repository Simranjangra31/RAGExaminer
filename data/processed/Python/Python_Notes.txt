Introduction to Python
What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity
and readability. It is widely used in academics, research, and industry.
History of Python
Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is maintained by the Python
Software Foundation.
