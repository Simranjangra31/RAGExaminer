OpenCV 
Introduction to OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) 
What is OpenCV? 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library designed for computer vision, image 
processing, and real-time video analysis. It provides a large collection of optimized algorithms that allow 
computers to understand and process visual data such as images and videos. 
OpenCV is widely used in academics, research, and industry because it is: 
• Free and open source 
• Fast and efficient 
• Cross-platform 
• Easy to integrate with machine learning and deep learning frameworks 
History and Development of OpenCV 
• Developed by Intel in 1999 
• Initially aimed at real-time computer vision applications 
• Later supported by Willow Garage and Itseez 
• Currently maintained by OpenCV.org 
• Written mainly in C++, with interfaces for Python, Java, MATLAB, etc. 
Why OpenCV is Important 
Modern applications require machines to: 
• Detect faces and objects 
• Track motion 
• Recognize patterns 
• Process live video streams 
OpenCV provides ready-to-use tools to solve these problems efficiently without implementing algorithms from 
scratch.
