Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized class of deep neural networks primarily designed to 
process grid-like data, such as images (2D grids of pixels), videos (3D: height × width × time), and even audio 
spectrograms. CNNs are the backbone of most modern computer vision systems. 
They automatically learn spatial features (edges, textures, shapes, objects) from raw input data with minimal 
manual feature engineering. 
Why CNNs are Needed 
Traditional fully connected neural networks (ANNs) face major issues when dealing with images: 
1. High dimensionality 
o A 224×224 RGB image has 150,528 input features 
o Fully connected layers lead to millions of parameters 
2. Loss of spatial information 
o ANNs flatten images → spatial relationships are lost 
3. Overfitting & computation cost 
CNNs solve these problems by: 
• Local connectivity 
• Weight sharing 
• Hierarchical feature learning 
Biological Inspiration 
CNNs are inspired by the visual cortex of the human brain: 
• Neurons respond to local regions of the visual field 
• Simple cells detect edges 
• Complex cells detect shapes and objects 
 
Core Idea of CNN 
CNNs use convolution operations to: 
• Detect local patterns 
• Preserve spatial structure 
• Learn features automatically 
Instead of learning all pixel relationships, CNNs focus on local receptive fields. 
Basic Architecture of CNN 
A typical CNN consists of the following layers: 
Input → Convolution → Activation → Pooling → (Repeat) → Fully Connected → Output 
 
2. Convolution Layer (Core of CNN) 
What is Convolution? 
A mathematical operation where a filter (kernel) slides over the image to produce a feature map. 
Kernel / Filter 
• Small matrix (e.g., 3×3, 5×5) 
• Learns to detect features such as: 
o Edges 
o Corners 
o Textures 
Operation 
Each output pixel is: 
Output = Sum(Input × Kernel) + Bias 
Parameters 
• Stride (S): step size of filter movement 
• Padding (P): adding zeros around input to preserve size 
o Valid padding → no padding 
o Same padding → output size = input size 
Output Size Formula 
Output = (N − F + 2P) / S + 1 
Where: 
• N = input size 
• F = filter size 
4. Pooling Layer (Downsampling) 
Purpose 
• Reduce spatial dimensions 
• Reduce computation 
• Provide translation invariance 
Types 
1. Max Pooling (most common) 
2. Average Pooling 
3. Global Average Pooling 
Example: 
2×2 Max Pooling → picks maximum value 
Training a CNN 
Loss Functions 
• Categorical Cross-Entropy 
• Binary Cross-Entropy 
• MSE (for regression) 
Optimization Algorithms 
• SGD 
• Adam 
• RMSProp 
Backpropagation 
• Gradients are computed 
• Filters are updated automatically 
Key Advantages of CNN 
1. Automatic feature extraction 
2. Fewer parameters (weight sharing) 
3. Spatial invariance 
4. High accuracy for vision tasks 
 
Limitations of CNN 
1. Requires large datasets 
2. Computationally expensive 
3. Poor rotation & scale invariance (without augmentation) 
4. Hard to interpret
